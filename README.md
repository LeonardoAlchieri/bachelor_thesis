# BACHELOR'S THESIS 
## GLITCHS CLASSIFICATION IN THE PLANCK/HFI DATA USING NEURAL NETWORKS
Code to clean Planck/HFI data and the neural network to analyse glitches in it.

This code provides 
  - the means to clean the Planck/HFI raw data from Dipole effect and avoid Galactic Interstellar Medium. 
  - scripts to classify manually timelines as glitches or not.
  - a convnet to train and recognize glitches.

I also decided to provide the result that I have obtained, a net whose _accuracy_ reached ~97% on training.

For more information, please feel free to contact me.

Special thanks to my supervisor, **Maurizo Tomasi**, and to **Paolo Galli**. 

Paolo Galli wrote some Machine Learning algorithms to address the same problem. Please go see his work at @Paolo97gll.
