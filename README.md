# BACHELOR'S THESIS
Code to clean Planck/HFI and the neural network to analyse it.

This code provides 
  - the means to clean the Planck/HFI raw data from Dipole effect and avoid Galactic Interstellar Medium. 
  - scripts to classify manually timelines as glitches or not.
  - a convnet to train and recognize glitches.

I also decided to provide the result that I have obtained, a net whose _accuracy_ reached ~97% on training.
